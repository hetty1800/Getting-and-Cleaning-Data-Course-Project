#run_analysis.R
#  This file contains the code needed to do the assignment,which refers to the followings:
#    1.Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
#    2.Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
#    3.Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
#    4.Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
#    5.From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
